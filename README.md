UDACITY SDCND Project4: Advanced Lane Finding_V3


In this project of Advance Lane Finding, I have considered follwoing points: 

1> Camera Calibration

2> Distortion Correction

3> Binary Threshold 

4> Perspective Transform

With these, I tried to find the lanes of different colors and identified the vehicle path under various conditions.

Here camera has been calibrated with the given chesboard calibration image and test images have been used for developing the pipeline.
Images during each steps have been stored at the output_images file. It consists of few images for the camera calibration, test image undistortion, birds eye images and binary threshold images.

Details of this code is presented in Writeup.
